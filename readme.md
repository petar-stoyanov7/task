### Purpose ###
This is a free open source web application, intended to let you track the expenses you made with your car, and then extract various statistics, such as cost per kilometer, overall money spent etc. This is still a work in progress, I have more features in mind and given the time - will implement them

This application is free to use. Redistribution is prohibited, just as using it for commercial purposes.
